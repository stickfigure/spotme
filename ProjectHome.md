The Spot (http://www.findmespot.com/) is a combination GPS/satmessenger that will produce an email with your location.  Spot Me provides java code for a Facebook application, runnable from procmail, that will take one of these emails and update your Facebook profile with your current location.

This project never published any code - sorry.
